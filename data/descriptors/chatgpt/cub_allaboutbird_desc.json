    "scarlet tanager": "Scarlet Tanagers are medium-sized songbirds with fairly stocky proportions. They have thick, rounded bills suitable both for catching insects and eating fruit. The head is fairly large and the tail is somewhat short and broad.In spring and summer, adult males are an unmistakable, brilliant red with black wings and tails. Females and fall immatures are olive-yellow with darker olive wings and tails. After breeding, adult males molt to female-like plumage, but with black wings and tail.Primarily insectivorous during the summer, Scarlet Tanagers also eat fruit during migration and on the wintering grounds. They spend much of their time skulking among the wide leaves of deciduous trees in the forest canopy, where they are hard to see. They sing a burry, rambling song and give a distinctive, harshchick-burrcall.Scarlet Tanagers breed in deciduous and mixed deciduous-evergreen forests in eastern North America. They are somewhat sensitive to habitat fragmentation, so look for them in large, undisturbed tracts of forest. During migration, they move through a broader variety of forest and shrubby habitats, as well as backyards.",
    "gray kingbird": "A large flycatcher with a big head, straight, heavy bill, and a rather long, notched tail.Adults are gray above, white below, with dark gray wings and tail, a dark gray mask, and a dark bill. Immatures are similar but with browner tones above.Forages conspicuously, perching high in open areas to scan for insects, which the birds chase down in rapid, agile flight, sometimes over long distances. Vocal and inquisitive.Nests in coastal areas, especially open and semiopen habitats, mangrove forest edges, and towns. Winters in similar habitats as well as openings in rainforest and in open valleys and cities of the northern Andes.",
    "long tailed jaeger": "Slender seabird; the smallest of the three jaegers. Breeding adults have an exceptionally long, pointed tail. Bill is shorter and proportionally thicker than other jaegers.Note uniform brownish back contrasting with dark flight feathers, limited clean black cap, and pale yellow on the side of the neck. Immature birds have an attractive scaly pattern on wings and vary from dark brown to a pale grayish white. Typically shows white shafts only on two outermost wing feathers (fewer than other jaegers).At all ages, note buoyant, ternlike flight. All jaegers chase other birds and steal their food.Breeds on Arctic tundra; spends the rest of the year at sea.",
    "tennessee warbler": "Small and stocky for a warbler, with a short tail and a thin and sharply pointed bill (markedly smaller and more pointed than a Red-eyed Vireo's bill).Breeding males have a gray head with a white line over the eye, contrasting with a green back and no wingbars. The underparts are whitish all the way through the undertail coverts. Females and nonbreeding males are more greenish, with less contrast between head and back. Occasionally very olive-yellow all over except for white undertail coverts.Tennessee Warblers forage on slender branches high in the forest canopy, feeding primarily on insects. On their breeding grounds a primary food is a small caterpillar called spruce budworm.Tennessee Warblers breed in coniferous or mixed deciduous-coniferous forest across Canada. On migration they can occur in most types of forests and woodlands. Winters in second-growth tropical forests.",
    "ovenbird": "The Ovenbird is a chunky, larger-than-average warbler, but still smaller than a Song Sparrow. It has a round head, fairly thick bill for a warbler, and a jaunty tail often cocked upward.Ovenbirds are olive-green above and spotted below, with bold black-and-orange crown stripes. A white eyering gives it a somewhat surprised expression. Like several other terrestrial, or near-terrestrial, warblers, Ovenbirds have pink legs.Ovenbirds spend much of their time foraging on the ground, often walking with a herky-jerky, wandering stroll that is unlike most terrestrial songbirds. Territorial males are very vocal and often sing from tree branches, occasionally quite high up. This is one of the few songbirds that habitually sings in the heat of midafternoon.Ovenbirds breed in closed-canopy forests, particularly deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous woods. You may find them in most forest types, from rich oak or maple woods to dry pine forest, although they avoid wet or swampy areas.",
    "yellow headed blackbird": "Yellow-headed Blackbirds are fairly large blackbirds, with a stout body, a large head, and a long, conical bill.Males are striking blackbirds with yellow heads and chests, and black bodies with prominent white patches at the bend of the wing. Females and immatures are brown instead of black, with duller yellow heads. Immature males show some white at the bend of the wing, while females don\u2019t.Yellow-headed Blackbirds breed in loose colonies, and males mate with several females. During the breeding season, they eat insects and aquatic invertebrates. They form huge flocks in winter, often mixing with other species of blackbirds, and feed on seeds and grains in cultivated fields.Yellow-headed Blackbirds breed and roost in freshwater wetlands with dense, emergent vegetation such as cattails. They often forage in fields, typically wintering in large, open agricultural areas.",
    "red legged kittiwake": "A small gull with a plump belly. Kittiwakes look sleek in flight, with rather long, narrow wings, a short, notched tail, and a slim, fairly short bill.Breeding adults are pale gray above with neat black wingtips, clean white below, with a yellow bill. The legs and feet are jet black. Nonbreeding adults are similar but acquire a dusky patch behind the ear. Juveniles are quite striking: white overall, with a black M pattern across the upperwing visible in flight. They also have a gray or black collar across the back of the neck, a black tail tip and a black bill.Forages while in flight by dipping or plunging into the sea, almost ternlike, to seize small fish and other prey, usually far offshore.Nests on seaside cliffs, often among auks and Northern Fulmars, in arctic, subarctic, and northern temperate regions. Forages over open ocean, mostly in cold waters.",
    "florida jay": "A large and sturdy bird with a long tail and hefty legs. This uncrested jay has a big flat head and a heavy bill.Dull blue overall with a whitish forehead and a pale gray back and belly. Juveniles are grayer overall than adults and lack the adult’s blue head.Hops on the ground or in trees and shrubs to pick insects and harvest acorns, which it buries in the ground to eat later. Often perches vertically on wires or exposed branches with its long tail hanging down.Found only in low-growing oak scrub and scrubby flatwoods with sandy soils in Florida. Within these patches of oak scrub, they frequent relatively open areas with bare sandy patches.",
    "brewer sparrow": "The Brewer\u2019s Sparrow is typical of theSpizellagroup of sparrows: dainty and slim, with a long, notched tail, short rounded wings, and a small, sharply conical bill. Its size varies somewhat by region and sex, but overall it is North America\u2019s smallest sparrow.Brewer\u2019s Sparrows are dusky gray-brown, with grayish underparts and a thin white eyering. The back and nape are streaked. A faint gray stripe over the eye contrasts with a darker eyeline. The throat is grayish white.On the breeding grounds, in spring and early summer, male Brewer\u2019s Sparrows sing long, trilled songs from atop sagebrush. These sparrows forage in dense shrubs to glean insect food and tend to stay out of open areas. During fall and winter they often convene in large flocks with otherSpizellasparrows.Brewer\u2019s Sparrows live in the arid sagebrush steppe of the interior West of North America, where they are the region\u2019s most abundant bird. In some northwestern mountains, a form known as the \u201cTimberline Sparrow\u201d lives among subalpine trees and dwarf shrubs.",
    "black and white warbler": "Black-and-white Warblers are medium-sized warblers (small songbirds). They have a fairly long, slightly downcurved bill. The head often appears somewhat flat and streamlined, with a short neck. The wings are long and the tail is short.These birds are boldly striped in black and white. Their black wings are highlighted by two wide, white wing bars. Adult males have more obvious black streaking, particularly on the underparts and the cheek. Females (especially immatures) are paler, with less streaking and usually a wash of buff on the flanks. The undertail coverts have distinctive large black spots.Black-and-white Warblers act more like nuthatches than warblers, foraging for hidden insects in the bark of trees by creeping up, down, and around branches and trunks. Despite their arboreal foraging habits, they nest on the ground at the bases of trees.Deciduous forest and mixed forest are the preferred summer habitats of Black-and-white Warblers, usually with trees of mixed ages that provide a variety of foraging substrates. On migration, look for them in any forest or woodlot. They winter in forests and forest edges from Florida to Colombia.",
    "pied kingfisher": "Boldly marked black-and-white kingfisher with short, bushy crest and glossy all-dark bill. Superficially similar to Crested Kingfisher, but smaller, with a much more distinctly patterned head and breast and less erect crest. Frequently seen perched in pairs or small groups. Often hovers over water when seeking prey. Inhabits a wide range of waterside habitats, from lakes to estuaries to mangroves. Gives a variety of sharp notes, as well as dry trilling and rattling calls.",
    "lincoln sparrow": "The Lincoln's Sparrow is a medium-sized sparrow with a dainty appearance. It has a rounded belly and head, but the back of its head often looks pointed or crested when it raises its crown feathers. Its tail is relatively short and its conical bill is a bit thinner compared to most other sparrows.The Lincoln's Sparrow is streaky brown, buffy, and gray overall with rusty edges to its wings and tail. Its chest and sides are rich buff with fine black streaking that fades into a white belly. Its face is marked by a buffy mustache stripe that is bordered by thin brown lines. A buffy eyering, a thick gray eyebrow, and a dark eyeline mark the area around the eye. Its crown is striped brown and black with a gray central crown stripe.Lincoln's Sparrows are secretive little birds that forage on or near the ground, rarely straying far from dense cover. During the breeding season, males sing either from exposed perches or tucked inside a shrub.These sparrows breed in wet meadows filled with willows, alders, and sedges. They also breed in patches of aspens, cottonwoods, and willows as well as shrubby areas near streams. During migration Lincoln's Sparrows use brushy fields, forest edges, and thickets. In winter, they use tropical forests, pine-oak forests, tropical scrub, weedy pastures, and shrubby fields.",
    "yellow bellied flycatcher": "A compact, small flycatcher with a big-eyed look and a big head that sometimes shows a peak at the rear. It has a short tail and a small but wide bill.Yellowish olive overall with a strong white eyering and two whitish wingbars. It has yellowish underparts all the way from its chin to its lower belly.Perches in the lower and middle levels of dense forests, from which it quickly flies out to grab insects in midair or from the vegetation. When perched it nervously turns its head and sometimes gently flicks its tail.Found in boreal coniferous forests, bogs, swamps, and peatlands during the breeding season and in dense rainforest, montane evergreen forest, pine-oak forest, and shaded coffee plantations during the winter.",
    "palm warbler": "Palm Warblers are small songbirds, but they are on the larger side for a warbler and have a fuller looking belly. Their posture is more upright than a typical warbler and more like a pipit\u2014especially noticeable when they are on the ground. Their tails and legs are longer than most warblers contributing to the pipitlike shape.Palm Warblers are dull brownish-olive above with yellow under the tail and throat. The outside corners of their tails flash white in flight. In eastern birds the belly is yellow, while in western birds the belly is white. Sexes are similar, and during the breeding season they have a rusty cap and some rusty streaking on the belly. Nonbreeding birds have paler yellow undertails and a dull brown crown.This is one bird where behavior\u2014this bird\u2019s near-constant tail-wagging\u2014can help confirm its identity. They mainly forage on open ground or in low vegetation, rather than in forest canopy as many warblers do (although they do sing from high perches in trees and shrubs).During migration and winter Palm Warblers use weedy fields, forest edges, fence rows, and other areas with scattered trees and shrubs. They breed in the boreal forest of the far north, where they use bogs with scattered evergreen trees and thick ground cover.",
    "tree sparrow": "American Tree Sparrows are small, round-headed birds that often fluff out their feathers, making their plump bodies look even chubbier. Among sparrows, they have fairly small bills and long, thin tails.A rusty cap and rusty (not black) eyeline on a gray head, a streaked brown back, and a smooth gray to buff breast in both male and female American Tree Sparrows give an overall impression of reddish-brown and gray. A dark smudge in the center of the unstreaked breast is common.Small flocks of American Tree Sparrows hop about on the ground, scrabbling for grass and weed seeds, calling back and forth with a soft, musical twitter. Individuals may perch in the open atop goldenrod stalks or shrubs, or on low tree branches.Look for small flocks of American Tree Sparrows in winter in weedy fields with hedgerows or shrubs, along forest edges, or near marshes. They readily visit backyards, especially if there's a seed feeder. American Tree Sparrows breed in the far north and are rarely seen south of northern Canada in summer.",
    "pileated woodpecker": "The Pileated Woodpecker is a very large woodpecker with a long neck and a triangular crest that sweeps off the back of the head. The bill is long and chisel-like, about the length of the head. In flight, the wings are broad and the bird can seem crowlike.Pileated Woodpeckers are mostly black with white stripes on the face and neck and a flaming-red crest. Males have a red stripe on the cheek. In flight, the bird reveals extensive white underwings and small white crescents on the upper side, at the bases of the primaries.Pileated Woodpeckers drill distinctive rectangular-shaped holes in rotten wood to get at carpenter ants and other insects. They are loud birds with whinnying calls. They also drum on dead trees in a deep, slow, rolling pattern, and even the heavy chopping sound of foraging carries well. Their flight undulates like other woodpeckers, which helps separate them from a crow\u2019s straight flight path.Pileated Woodpeckers are forest birds that require large, standing dead trees and downed wood. Forests can be evergreen, deciduous, or mixed and are often old, particularly in the West. In the East they live in young forests as well and may even be seen in partially wooded suburbs and backyards.",
    "sage thrasher": "Sage Thrashers are fairly small songbirds with relatively long legs and tail. They are the smallest of the thrashers. The bill is much shorter and straighter than the bills of other thrashers. When perched, Sage Thrashers often stand erect with their wings slightly drooped, like a thrush.Sage Thrashers are drab gray above with spotted underparts. Black spotting on the breast turns to fine streaks along cinnamon-tinged flanks. In summer, these streaks can become less distinct from feather wear. Tips of the outer tail feathers are white, there are two whitish wingbars, and the eye is yellow.The often shy Sage Thrasher runs stealthily through the brush, along corridors of bare ground. During spring and summer, singing males perch prominently atop the tallest shrubs. When alarmed, Sage Thrashers flick their tail upward repeatedly.Look for Sage Thrashers in expanses of dense sagebrush with scattered bunchgrasses and bare ground. During migration and winter, they occupy a broader rage of open, arid habitats, such as grasslands with scattered shrubs and open pinyon-juniper woodlands.",
    "gray crowned rosy finch": "A small songbird with a short, conical bill and a fairly short tail. Subspecies on the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands are considerably larger, shaped more like a grosbeak than a small finch.Adult males are rich brown suffused with pink on the body, with gray sides of the head and a black forecrown and throat. Adult females are similar but with less extensive pink. The bill is yellow. Juveniles are brownish overall with grayish wings and a dusky bill.Hops along on the ground in search of seeds and insects, typically near snowfields or snowmelt. In winter, often forages in flocks mixed with other rosy-finch species, which fly up in whirls from feeding areas and roadsides.Nests high on mountains, in boulder fields and cliffs, and forages on scree slopes, ice fields, glaciers, meadows, and avalanche areas. Descends to open areas in lower elevations in winter, sometimes into forests and towns, especially where there are feeders.",
    "red eyed vireo": "Red-eyed Vireos are large, chunky vireos with a long, angular head, thick neck, and a strong, long bill with a small but noticeable hook at the tip. The body is stocky and the tail fairly short.Red-eyed Vireos are olive-green above and clean white below with a strong head pattern: a gray crown and white eyebrow stripe bordered above and below by blackish lines. The flanks and under the tail have a green-yellow wash. Adults have red eyes that appear dark from a distance; immatures have dark eyes.They forage in deciduous canopies where they can be difficult to find among the green leaves. They move slowly and methodically, carefully scanning leaves above and below for their favored caterpillar prey. However, their habit of near-incessant singing in summer, even in the heat of midafternoon, helps draw attention to them.Large expanses of deciduous forest, particularly deciduous trees with large leaves (such as maples), typify Red-eyed Vireo habitat during the breeding season. On migration, look for them in nearly any type of forest, woodland, or woodlot (particularly in deciduous stands). It is often the commonest of vireo migrants.",
    "whip poor will": "Eastern Whip-poor-wills are medium-sized birds with a large, rounded head and a stout chest that tapers to a long tail and wings, giving them a distinctly front-heavy look. Like all nightjars, Eastern Whip-poor-wills are patterned with a complicated mottling of gray and brown, which camouflages them nearly perfectly with leaf litter or tree bark. They have a blackish throat bordered at the bottom by a neat, white bib. Males have white corners to the tail; on females, these spots are dull buff. Eastern Whip-poor-wills are strictly nocturnal. At night they rest on the ground or perch horizontally on low trees and fly up to catch moths and other aerial insects. They chant their loud, namesake whip-poor-will song continuously on spring and summer evenings. During the day, Eastern Whip-poor-wills roost on the ground or on a tree limb and are very difficult to spot. Look for Eastern Whip-poor-wills in eastern forests with open understories. They can be found in both purely deciduous and mixed deciduous-pine forests, often in areas with sandy soil.",
    "red breasted merganser": "A large, slim, and long-bodied diving duck with a fairly long neck and a long, thin, serrated bill. A shaggy crest of feathers gives the head a distinctive profile.Breeding males have a cinnamon chest, a white neck band, and a shaggy green head. Female and nonbreeding males are brownish gray overall with a brownish chin, a dingy breast, and a brown shaggy head. In flight both sexes have a prominent white lower wing panel.Red-breasted Mergansers tend to sit low in the water and fly at an angle with the head higher than their feet. They swim with the head partially submerged, diving underwater to capture small fish with their serrated bill.Breeds in the boreal forest on fresh, brackish, and saltwater wetlands, typically close to the coast. During migration and on the wintering grounds, uses marine waters, lakes, and rivers. They tend to use saltwater, including estuaries and bays, more often than Common Merganser.",
    "crested auklet": "Dumpy, dark alcid with pale eyes; very small, only slightly larger than a sparrow. Note the thin white “whiskers” trailing backwards from behind each eye. Breeding birds are dark gray-black overall, with a droopy forward-arching crest and a bright orange bill with an uptilted gape which gives them a maniacally grinning appearance. Non-breeding adults and immatures are duller, with a smaller, darker bill and the barest hints of a crest. Breeds in immense colonies on remote rocky islands and forages out at sea. Very vocal at colonies, but also gives occasional yapping barks when out foraging in groups.",
    "northern fulmar": "Looks superficially like a gull. A heavyset, medium-sized seabird with a short neck, stout body, large head, and long wings. The bill is stout and hooked, with two nasal tubes on the top edge.Most fulmars are \"light morph\": gray above and white below, a pattern similar to large gulls. Some \"dark morphs\" occur in the North Pacific and are pale to dark gray all over.Flies with very stiff, shallow wingbeats interspersed with glides, a style very different from gulls. Catches prey at the sea surface or makes shallow dives underwater. Often forages in large flocks, mixed with other seabird species and sometimes marine mammals.Nests in dense colonies on rocky islands and cliffs. Forages far offshore, where upwelling brings nutrients and fish toward the surface. Also collects around fishing vessels to scavenge discarded fish parts.",
    "caspian tern": "A large, heavy-bodied seabird (and largest of all terns), with a large head; thick, straight, pointed bill; and shallowly forked tail. The long, pointed wings are broad for a tern.White overall, with pale gray upperwings. From below, the outer primaries in the wing are dark gray. Breeding adults have a black crown; winter adults and juveniles have a partially black crown with grayish speckling. The bill is coral red with a dusky tip. Feet and legs are blackish.Flies slowly above the water, then dives swiftly on prey (mostly fish). Usually plunges underwater but sometimes catches fish without submerging. Rests and roosts in flocks, often among other terns and gulls. Nests in large colonies or solitarily, always near water.Breeds in open flat areas along coastlines, beaches, or on islands, very near freshwater or saltwater. Migrates through interior of continent and along coastlines, using rivers, reservoirs, lagoons, estuaries, and ocean waters. Winters mostly in coastal zones near saltwater, less often on interior lakes or rivers.",
    "green violetear": "Rather large, overall bright green hummingbird of highlands. Favors pine-oak forest and edge, especially overgrown clearings and roadsides with dense flower banks. Fairly common and is especially conspicuous when singing. Song is a jerky, metallic, chipping song given tirelessly from an exposed twig at middle to upper levels in trees. When feeding often stays fairly well hidden within flowers. Note overall deep green plumage with dark violet cheek and breast patches, and broad dark tail band.",
    "artic tern": "Arctic Terns are slender terns with long, angular wings and pointed wingtips. They have a small round head with a steep forehead and extremely short legs. Breeding adults have a deeply forked tail.Breeding adults are pale gray above and below. They have a full black cap that extends down the back of the neck, a red bill, and red legs. Nonbreeding birds have a white forehead with smaller black cap restricted to the back of the head and neck. Nonbreeders also have a black bill, black legs, and a dark gray bar across the shoulder (carpal bar).Arctic Terns fly gracefully with rowing wingbeats over open waters, diving down to pick fish from or just below the water's surface. They tend to hover above foraging areas and nesting colonies more often than the similar Common Tern. They migrate over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans often far out to sea.Arctic Terns breed across the Arctic in treeless areas with little to no vegetation, in open boreal forests, and on islands and barrier beaches on the northeastern Atlantic Coast. They migrate over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to food-rich waters around Antarctica where they hang out on pack ice during the Southern Hemisphere's summer.",
    "tree swallow": "Tree Swallows are streamlined small songbirds with long, pointed wings and a short, squared or slightly notched tail. Their bills are very short and flat.Adult males are blue-green above and white below with blackish flight feathers and a thin black eye mask; females are duller with more brown in their upperparts, and juveniles are completely brown above. Juveniles and some females can show a weak, blurry gray-brown breast band.Tree Swallows feed on small, aerial insects that they catch in their mouths during acrobatic flight. After breeding, Tree Swallows gather in large flocks to molt and migrate. In the nonbreeding season, they form huge communal roosts.Tree Swallows breed in open habitats such as fields and wetlands, usually adjacent to water. They nest in artificial nest boxes as well as tree cavities. Foraging flocks are frequently seen over wetlands, water, and agricultural fields.",
    "nighthawk": "Common Nighthawks are medium-sized, slender birds with very long, pointed wings and medium-long tails. Only the small tip of the bill is usually visible, and this combined with the large eye and short neck gives the bird a big-headed look. Common Nighthawks are well camouflaged in gray, white, buff, and black. The long, dark wings have a striking white blaze about two-thirds of the way out to the tip. In flight, a V-shaped white throat patch contrasts with the rest of the bird’s mottled plumage. Look for Common Nighthawks flying in looping patterns in mornings and evenings. During the day, they roost motionless on a tree branch, fencepost, or the ground and are very difficult to see. When migrating or feeding over insect-rich areas such as lakes or well-lit billboards, nighthawks may gather in large flocks. Their buzzy, American Woodcock-like peent call is distinctive. Common Nighthawks are most visible when they forage on the wing over open areas near woods or wetlands. They nest on the ground in open areas such as gravel bars, forest clearings, coastal sand dunes, or sparsely vegetated grasslands.",
    "eastern towhee": "Towhees are a kind of large sparrow. Look for their thick, triangular, seed-cracking bill as a tip-off they\u2019re in the sparrow family. Also notice the chunky body and long, rounded tail.Males are striking: bold sooty black above and on the breast, with warm rufous sides and white on the belly. Females have the same pattern, but are rich brown where the males are black.Eastern Towhees spend most of their time on the ground, scratching at leaves using both feet at the same time, in a kind of backwards hop. They spend lots of time concealed beneath thick underbrush. You may see this bird more often when it climbs into shrubs and low trees to sing.Look for Eastern Towhees in brush, tangles, thickets, and along forest edges where there\u2019s plenty of leaf litter for the birds to forage in.",
    "black billed cuckoo": "Cuckoos are slender, dove-sized birds with a longer slightly curved bill and a very long tail. When perched it often has a hunchbacked posture.Black-billed Cuckoos are plain brown above without cinnamon tones and white below with a red ring around the eye and a black bill. From below, note the small white tips on the tail feathers.Sluggish and secretive, the Black-billed Cuckoo often hides in dense vegetation, perching motionless in the trees. It feasts on caterpillars especially fall web worms and tent caterpillars.Black-billed Cuckoos breed in dense woodlands and thickets with deciduous and evergreen trees, often near water. During migration they forage in thickets, woodlands, orchards, gardens, and scrublands. On the wintering grounds they also use thickets, woodlands, and scrub.",
    "sooty albatross": "A beautiful smoky-brown albatross with bright white eye crescents and an orange line running down the bill that gives this otherwise regal bird a goofy appearance. Unlike the otherwise similar Light-mantled Albatross, the present species’ dark head does not contrast with the rest of the body. Also note Light-mantled’s less obvious blue-gray bill line. Dark morph giant-petrels can be similar at a glance, but have larger, bulbous pink bills, and average more long-necked and hunch-backed in appearance. A pelagic species, ranging throughout much of the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Nests on a handful of islands in that region, favoring areas with steep rocky slopes and tussock grass.",
    "belted kingfisher": "Belted Kingfishers are stocky, large-headed birds with a shaggy crest on the top and back of the head and a straight, thick, pointed bill. Their legs are short and their tails are medium length and square-tipped.These kingfishers are blue-gray above with fine, white spotting on the wings and tail. The underparts are white with a broad, blue breast band. Females also have a broad rusty band on their bellies. Juveniles show irregular rusty spotting in the breast band.Belted Kingfishers spend much of their time perched alone along the edges of streams, lakes, and estuaries, searching for small fish. They also fly quickly up and down rivers and shorelines giving loud rattling calls. They hunt either by plunging directly from a perch, or by hovering over the water, bill downward, before diving after a fish they\u2019ve spotted.Kingfishers live near streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and estuaries. They nest in burrows that they dig into soft earthen banks, usually adjacent to or directly over water. Kingfishers spend winters in areas where the water doesn\u2019t freeze so that they have continual access to their aquatic foods.",
    "carolina wren": "The Carolina Wren is a small but chunky bird with a round body and a long tail that it often cocks upward. The head is large with very little neck, and the distinctive bill marks it as a wren: long, slender, and downcurved.Both males and females are a bright, unpatterned reddish-brown above and warm buffy-orange below, with a long white eyebrow stripe, dark bill, and white chin and throat.The Carolina Wren creeps around vegetated areas and scoots up and down tree trunks in search of insects and fruit. It explores yards, garages, and woodpiles, sometimes nesting there. This wren often cocks its tail upward while foraging and holds it down when singing. Carolina Wrens defend their territories with constant singing; they aggressively scold and chase off intruders.Look\u2014or listen\u2014for Carolina Wrens singing or calling from dense vegetation in wooded areas, especially in forest ravines and neighborhoods. These birds love to move low through tangled understory; they frequent backyard brush piles and areas choked with vines and bushes.",
    "pelagic cormorant": "A large seabird with a long, thin neck, a long tail, and a narrow, small head. Breeding adults have short crests on the front of the crown and the hindcrown. Pelagic Cormorants are smaller and slenderer than other cormorant species of the Pacific.Breeding adults are blackish, with green or purple gloss. They have a small patch of red skin around the bill, and square white patches on the flanks. Nonbreeding adults are similar but less glossy, with dull facial skin and without the white flank patches. Juveniles are uniformly dark brown.Dives to pursue fish and other marine organisms underwater, which are captured from below or pulled from rocky reefs. Most foraging is done in the morning or late afternoon. During the day, Pelagic Cormorants perch on rocks, pilings, or other waterside objects, resting and drying the plumage, often with wings outstretched.Nests on rocky islands, cliffs, and shorelines of the Pacific; forages in waters adjacent to nesting areas, rarely more than a few miles from land. Nonbreeding birds use similar habitats.",
    "rose breasted grosbeak": "Rose-breasted Grosbeaks are stocky, medium-sized songbirds with very large triangular bills. They are broad-chested, with a short neck and a medium-length, squared tail.Adult males are black-and-white birds with a brilliant red chevron extending from the black throat down the middle of the breast. Females and immatures are brown and heavily streaked, with a bold whitish stripe over the eye. Males flash pink-red under the wings; females flash yellowish. Both sexes show white patches in the wings and tail.These chunky birds use their stout bills to eat seeds, fruit, and insects. They are also frequent visitors to backyard bird feeders, where they eat sunflower seeds with abandon. The sweet, rambling song of a male Rose-breasted Grosbeak is a familiar voice of eastern forests; their sharp \u201cchink\u201d calls are also very distinctive.Rose-breasted Grosbeaks breed in eastern forests; you can find them among both deciduous trees and conifers. They are most common in regenerating woodlands and often concentrate along forest edges and in parks. During migration, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks frequent fruiting trees to help fuel their flights to Central and South America.",
    "red bellied woodpecker": "A sleek, round-headed woodpecker, about the same size as a Hairy Woodpecker but without the blocky outlines.Often appears pale overall, even the boldly black-and-white striped back, with flashing red cap and nape. Look for white patches near the wingtips as this bird flies.Look for Red-bellied Woodpeckers hitching along branches and trunks of medium to large trees, picking at the bark surface more often than drilling into it. Like most woodpeckers, these birds have a characteristic undulating flight pattern.Red-bellied Woodpeckers are common in many Eastern woodlands and forests, from old stands of oak and hickory to young hardwoods and pines. They will also often venture from forests to appear at backyard feeders.",
    "boat tailed grackle": "Boat-tailed Grackles are large, lanky songbirds with rounded crowns, long legs, and fairly long, pointed bills.

They also have an orange bill tipped in black and orange legs. Nonbreeding birds have a white forehead, a partial black cap, and black legs and bill. They also have a black bar across the shoulder known as a carpal bar and dark trailing edges on the wingtips as seen in flight.Terns fly gracefully with rowing wingbeats over open waters, diving down to pick fish from or just below the water's surface. They are vocal and gregarious birds that make their presence well known.Common Terns nest on rocky islands, barrier beaches, and saltmarshes and forage over open waters including inlets, lakes, and marine waters. During the breeding season they frequent both salt and freshwater, but during the winter they tend to stick to marine environments.",
    "hooded warbler": "Hooded Warblers are small, well-proportioned birds with a straight, sharp bill. Compared to other warblers, they are fairly heavy-bodied and thick-necked.Adult males are olive-green above and bright yellow below with a black hood and throat, a yellow forehead, and yellow cheeks. Females and immatures are also olive-green above and yellow below, but they don't have a black hood, although some adult females show an outline of a hood. Note the large black eye and white outer tail feathers that it often flashes.This warbler spends much of its time in the understory flitting between shrubs and flashing its white outer tail feathers. It tends to stay at least partially hidden in understory vegetation, jumping up to take insects or picking them from foliage.Hooded Warblers are found in mature deciduous forests with a dense understory, but also uses smaller forest patches as long as there is a shrubby understory.",
    "henslow sparrow": "A small, squat sparrow with a large, flat head, a large bill, and a short, spiky tail.Henslow\u2019s Sparrows are tan and buff marked with sharp black streaks. They have a distinctly greenish-olive wash on the cheek, with a yellow spot between eye and bill. The breast has neat black streaks and the belly is whitish.Henslow\u2019s Sparrows are extremely secretive, spending much of their time foraging at the bases of grass stalks in dense weedy fields. They prefer to run or walk rather than fly, and when flushed their escape flights are short and erratic.Henslow\u2019s Sparrows can be found in weedy hayfields or pastures, wet meadows and, in winter, saltmarshes.",
    "horned lark": "Horned Larks are small, long-bodied songbirds that usually adopt a horizontal posture. They have short, thin bills, short necks, and rounded heads\u2014the shape sometimes broken by two small \u201chorns\u201d of feathers sticking up toward the back of the head.Male Horned Larks are sandy to rusty brown above, with a black chest band, a curving black mask, and head stripes that extend to the back of the head (sometimes raised into tiny \u201chorns\u201d). The face and throat are either yellow or white (see Regional Differences). The underparts are white. Females have similar head and breast patterns but are less crisply defined.Horned Larks are social birds, sometimes found in huge flocks outside the breeding season. They creep along bare ground searching for small seeds and insects. They often mix with other open-country species in winter flocks, including longspurs and Snow Buntings.The barer the ground, the more Horned Larks like it. Look for them in open country with very short or no vegetation, including bare agricultural fields. They breed in short grassland, short-stature sage shrubland, desert, and even alpine and arctic tundra.",

In flight, they look barrel-chested and broad-winged compared to smaller species such as Ring-billed Gulls.Adults have light-gray backs, black wingtips, and white heads and underparts. In winter, dusky streaks mark their heads. Herring Gulls take four years to reach adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown; second-year birds are brown but show gray on the back. Third-years have more gray on the back and more white on the head and underparts. The legs are dull pink at all ages.Herring Gulls patrol shorelines and open ocean, picking scraps off the surface. Rallying around fishing boats or refuse dumps, they are loud and competitive scavengers, happy to snatch another bird's meal. They spend much of their time perched near food sources, often in congregations of gulls.Look for Herring Gulls in winter along coasts and near large reservoirs, lakes, and major rivers. They feed in habitats as diverse as open water, mudflats, plowed fields, and garbage dumps, and gather in almost any open space near food. In summer, they\u2019re most likely to be seen along the Atlantic Coast, Great Lakes, and coastal Alaska; they also breed across the boreal far north.",

The back is mottled tan, black, and chestnut, and isn\u2019t as streaky as other sparrows. The face is relatively plain with a conspicuous white eyering. They often show a yellow spot between the eye and bill (the lore), and on the bend of the wing.Grasshopper Sparrows typically stay close to the ground, preferring to run or walk rather than fly. During the breeding season, males sing from exposed or partially exposed perches near the tops of grass stalks or along barbed wire fences.This species breeds in open grasslands, prairies, hayfields, and pastures, typically with some bare ground. Grasshopper Sparrows usually avoid breeding in grasslands with extensive shrub cover, but are a bit more tolerant of shrubs in migration and during the winter.",
    "red cockaded woodpecker": "Red-cockaded Woodpeckers are small woodpeckers with short, straight bills.Despite their name, they are largely black and white, with a large, bright-white cheek patch and a bold black malar stripe forming the lower border of the cheek. Males have a tiny, nearly invisible red streak (\u201ccockade\u201d) at the upper border of the cheek. The back has strong horizontal black-and-white bars.Red-cockaded Woodpeckers live in family groups and cooperate to raise young. They often forage in small groups and can be quite vocal. They excavate nest and roost cavities in living pine trees, pecking holes in the bark to keep a flow of sticky pitch around the nest cavity.This endangered species is a habitat specialist that is strongly tied to old-growth pine forests that burn frequently, leaving the understory mostly clear of younger pines and hardwoods. They were once common in vast tracts of longleaf pine; now they also occur in loblolly, slash, and some other pine stands in the southeastern pine flatwoods.",

It has pointed but broad wings, and its medium-length tail shows a shallow notch in the center.A gray-headed bird with bright yellow underparts and a pale gray-green back. It has a whitish throat and dark gray-brown wings and tail.Forages by catching large flying insects on the wing, sallying out from a favored perch (often a telephone line) and returning to it to consume the prey. Also feeds on fruits, particularly during cooler weather. Perches conspicuously and when nesting flies out to confront many sorts of birds that come too close to the nest.Found in almost any open or semiopen habitat in most of the range; in the United States, favors parks, towns, and rural areas with scattered trees for nesting and other perches for hunting, often near water.",
    "pomarine jaeger": "Bulky gull-like seabird; the largest and most barrel chested of the three jaegers. At all ages, note broad wings. Breeding adults are unique with elongated spoon-shaped central tail feathers. Bill is also thicker than other jaegers.Note blackish-brown upperparts, messy black cap that extends below the bill, and extensive white flash on upper and underside of outer wing. Rare dark morph adult is entirely blackish-brown but still has white wing flashes. Immature birds are variable, but in general they are barred with brown above and have bold black-and-white bars on the underwing and undertail coverts. Typically shows white shafts on 6 to 8 outer wing feathers (more than other jaegers) and more obvious white flash on underwing.All jaegers chase other birds and steal their food.

    "white pelican": "A huge waterbird with very broad wings, a long neck, and a massive bill that gives the head a unique, long shape. They have thick bodies, short legs, and short, square tails. During the breeding season, adults grow an unusual projection or horn on the upper mandible near the tip of the bill. Adult American White Pelicans are snowy white with black flight feathers visible only when the wings are spread. A small patch of ornamental feathers on the chest can become yellow in spring. The bill and legs are yellow-orange. Immatures are mostly white as well, but the head, neck, and back are variably dusky. American White Pelicans feed from the water’s surface, dipping their beaks into the water to catch fish and other aquatic organisms. They often upend, like a very large dabbling duck, in this process. They do not plunge-dive the way Brown Pelicans do. They are superb soarers (they are among the heaviest flying birds in the world) and often travel long distances in large flocks by soaring. When flapping, their wingbeats are slow and methodical. American White Pelicans typically breed on islands in shallow wetlands in the interior of the continent. They spend winters mainly on coastal waters, bays, and estuaries, or a little distance inland.",
    "bay breasted warbler": "A small songbird with a fine, pointed bill and rather long wings and tail.Breeding males are grayish above with a reddish-brown crown, breast and flanks, black face, and creamy buff underparts and rear cheek. Breeding females are similar but lack black mask and have less bay color. In the nonbreeding plumage, yellow-green upperparts and whitish underparts, usually with a hint of pinkish brown on the flanks. All plumages have two strong white wingbars.Bay-breasted Warblers feed by hopping and flying around in the inner parts of trees and watching for insect prey, which they capture by gleaning and occasionally hovering. They readily join mixed-species flocks in the nonbreeding season, when they consume more fruit than insects.Breeds in boreal forests, chiefly mature coniferous forests. Winters in wet lowland tropical forests. Migrants use many types of forest and edge habitats.",
    "pigeon guillemot": "A medium-sized seabird with a small head and medium-length, sharply pointed bill. The neck and tail are fairly short; the wings are short and narrow (helps with \u201cflying\u201d underwater).Adult in breeding plumage is mostly dark brown (black from a distance), with dark underwings and white patches in upperwings that are partly broken by a black bar. The feet and interior of the mouth are vivid scarlet. Adults in nonbreeding plumage retain white wing patches but have a mostly whitish head, neck, and underparts. Juveniles are similar but with grayish feathers on the head, neck, and sides and less white in the upperwing.The Pigeon Guillemot dives and swims underwater, flapping its wings for propulsion. It catches fish, worms, and crustaceans one at a time, seizing them from between rocks, among algae, or in the water. It usually forages alone and away from other species as well. Breeds in rocky crevices along the coast or on islands and feeds very near nest sites.Nests on rocky islands, shorelines, and cliffs. Forages near the ocean shoreline and in openings in sea ice.",
    "black footed albatross": "A very large seabird with long, narrow wings, a heavy head and neck, and a long, hooked bill.Dark brown overall, sometimes with whitish plumage in uppertail and undertail coverts or on the face. Feet and bill blackish.Albatrosses have a very distinctive flight style known as dynamic soaring. They rarely flap their wings except in very light winds. They typically fly low to the water, sometimes down in the wave troughs, and then swoop up into the sky, catch the wind, and accelerate downwind before swooping low to the water again. Often forages in groups, sometimes mixed with other seabirds and marine mammals.Nests on low, sandy islands in the tropical North Pacific. Forages both near to shore (though usually not within sight of land) and far offshore, in places where upwelling or converging currents concentrate nutrients and prey at the sea surface.",

The Cactus Wren is the largest wren in the United States and is similar in size to a Spotted Towhee.The Cactus Wren is a speckled brown bird with bright white eyebrows that extend from the bill, across and above their red eyes, to the sides of the neck. They have pale cinnamon sides and a white chest with dark speckles. The back is brown with heavy white streaks, and the tail is barred white and black\u2014especially noticeable from below. Males and females look alike, but juveniles are slightly paler and have a brown eye.Unlike other wrens that typically hide in vegetation, the Cactus Wren seems to have no fear. They perch atop cacti and other shrubs to announce their presence and forage out in the open. They do not cock their tails over their back the way other wrens do. Instead they fan their tail feathers, flashing white tail tips.Cactus Wrens live in deserts, arid foothills, coastal sage scrub, and urban areas throughout the Southwestern deserts, especially in areas with thorny shrubs, cholla, and prickly pear.",

Their wings are short, rounded, and broad, making the tail seem particularly long in flight. Mockingbirds are overall gray-brown, paler on the breast and belly, with two white wingbars on each wing. A white patch in each wing is often visible on perched birds, and in flight these become large white flashes. The white outer tail feathers are also flashy in flight. The Northern Mockingbird enjoys making its presence known. It usually sits conspicuously on high vegetation, fences, eaves, or telephone wires, or runs and hops along the ground. Found alone or in pairs throughout the year, mockingbirds aggressively chase off intruders on their territory. Look for Northern Mockingbirds in towns, suburbs, backyards, parks, forest edges, and open land at low elevations.",
    "brewer blackbird": "A small, fairly long-legged songbird with the well-proportioned look of many blackbirds: the fairly long tail is balanced by a full body, round head, and long, thick-based beak. In perching males, the tail appears widened and rounded toward the tip.Males are glossy black all over with a staring yellow eye and a blue sheen on the head grading to greenish iridescence on the body. Females are plainer brown, darkest on the wings and tail, with a dark eye. Immature birds look like washed out, lighter-brown versions of the females.Brewer\u2019s Blackbirds feed on open ground or underfoot in parks and busy streets. Their long legs give them a halting walk, head jerking with each step almost like a chicken\u2019s. In flocks, Brewer\u2019s Blackbirds rise and fall as they fly. At landing, birds may circle in a slow fluttering flight before settling.Look for Brewer\u2019s Blackbirds in open habitats of the West, such as coastal scrub, grasslands, riversides, meadows, as well as lawns, golf courses, parks, and city streets.",
    "scissor tailed flycatcher": "Scissor-tailed Flycatchers are slender, stout-billed kingbirds with very long, stiff, deeply forked tails.

Adults have salmon-pink flanks that extend to underwing patches that are very conspicuous in flight. Males are more intensely colored than females.Scissor-tailed Flycatchers perch conspicuously on utility lines, treetops, and fence lines to watch for insect prey and defend their territories from interlopers. They are agile in the air, spreading their long tails wide to make abrupt turns and stalls. They are highly territorial, and will chase other birds out of their territories accompanied by loud, squeaky, bubbling calls.Scissor-tailed Flycatchers breed in open habitats in the southern Great Plains and south Texas, especially around scattered trees or utility lines. They tolerate human presence well and frequently breed in towns.",
    "blue grosbeak": "The Blue Grosbeak is a stocky songbird with a very large, triangular bill that seems to cover the entire front of its face, from throat to forehead.Adult males are deep, rich blue with a tiny black mask in front of the eyes, chestnut wingbars, and a black-and-silver beak. Females are primarily rich cinnamon-brown. The color is richer on the head, paler on the underparts; their tails are bluish. Both sexes have two wingbars; the upper is chestnut and the lower is grayish to buffy. Immature Blue Grosbeaks tend to a rich, dark chestnut brown, with chestnut wingbars.Blue Grosbeaks are unobtrusive despite their bright colors, although in summer males frequently sing their pleasant, rich, warbling songs. Often they sing while perched at high points in the shrubs and small trees of their generally open or shrubby habitats. Listen for their loud, almost metallic chink call. Also watch for this species\u2019 odd habit of twitching its tail sideways.Blue Grosbeaks are characteristic species of old fields beginning to grow back into woodland. They breed in areas covered in a mix of grass, forbs, and shrubs, with usually a few taller trees. In more-arid areas, they often use the shrubby growth along watercourses.",
    "baltimore oriole": "Smaller and more slender than an American Robin, Baltimore Orioles are medium-sized, sturdy-bodied songbirds with thick necks and long legs. Look for their long, thick-based, pointed bills, a hallmark of the blackbird family they belong to.Adult males are flame-orange and black, with a solid-black head and one white bar on their black wings. Females and immature males are yellow-orange on the breast, grayish on the head and back, with two bold white wing bars.Baltimore Orioles are more often heard than seen as they feed high in trees, searching leaves and small branches for insects, flowers, and fruit. You may also spot them lower down, plucking fruit from vines and bushes or sipping from hummingbird feeders. Watch for the male\u2019s slow, fluttering flights between tree tops and listen for their characteristicwinkor chatter calls.Look for Baltimore Orioles high in leafy deciduous trees, but not in deep forests: they\u2019re found in open woodland, forest edge, orchards, and stands of trees along rivers, in parks, and in backyards.",
    "myrtle warbler": "Yellow-rumped Warblers are fairly large, full-bodied warblers with a large head, sturdy bill, and long, narrow tail. In summer, both sexes are a smart gray with flashes of white in the wings and yellow on the face, sides, and rump. Males are very strikingly shaded; females are duller and may show some brown. Winter birds are paler brown, with bright yellow rump and usually some yellow on the sides. Yellow-rumped Warblers typically forage in the outer tree canopies at middle heights. They're active, and you'll often see them sally out to catch insects in midair, sometimes on long flights. In winter they spend lots of time eating berries from shrubs, and they often travel in large flocks.

In fall and winter they move to open woods and shrubby habitats, including coastal vegetation, parks, and residential areas.",
    "least auklet": "An abundant tiny auklet, only slightly larger than a sparrow. Occurs in large colonies around rocky shores during summer, and in smaller flocks further from the coast during winter. Summer plumage appears messy with numerous gray spots around the belly. Winter plumage is more contrastingly marked with flashing white belly and shoulders. Gives frequent, consistent squawks and squeaks at colonies. Readily separable from other auklets due to its whiter plumage and smaller size.",
    "fox sparrow": "Fox Sparrows are large, round-bodied sparrows with stout bills and medium-length tails.Though highly variable (see \u201cRegional Differences\u201d), Fox Sparrows are generally rust-brown above with a mix of rust and gray on the head, and heavy brownish splotches on the flanks and the center of the chest. The bill can range from yellowish to dark gray.Fox Sparrows spend a lot of time on the ground, using their sturdy legs to kick away leaf litter in search of insects and seeds. They rarely venture far from cover, and they frequently associate with other sparrows. In spring and summer, listen for Fox Sparrows\u2019 sweet, whistled song from scrub or forest; also, pay attention for a sharpsmackcall.Fox Sparrows breed in coniferous forest and dense mountain scrub. They spend winters in scrubby habitat and forest, when they are most likely to be seen kicking around under backyard bird feeders.",

    "black throated blue warbler": "Black-throated Blue Warblers are small, well-proportioned birds with sharp, pointed bills. Compared with other warblers, they are fairly large and plump.Males are midnight blue above and white below with black on the throat, face, and sides. Females are plain grayish olive overall, although some individuals have blue tints on the wings and tail. Both sexes have a characteristic small white square on the wing, sometimes called a \u201cpocket handkerchief.\u201dThese birds forage in the understory and lower canopy of forests, where they pick insects from the undersides of leaves. Males sing to defend their breeding territories and aggressively chase away rival males.Black-throated Blue Warblers are found in larger tracts of hardwood and mixed hardwood-evergreen forests with a shrubby understory.",
    "gadwall": "Gadwall are about the same size as Mallards. Gadwall have a fairly large, square head with a steep forehead. The bill is noticeably thinner than a Mallard's.

Females are patterned with brown and buff. Females have a thin orange edge to their dark bills. In flight, both sexes have a white wing patch that is sometimes visible while swimming or resting.Gadwall feed with other dabbling ducks, tipping forward to feed on submerged vegetation without diving. They sometimes steal food from flocks of diving ducks or coots. You'll often see these ducks in pairs through the winter, because they select their mates for the breeding season as early as late fall.Gadwall breed mainly in the Great Plains and prairies. On migration and in winter, look for Gadwall in reservoirs, ponds, fresh and salt water marshes, city parks, sewage ponds, or muddy edges of estuaries.",
    "least flycatcher": "Least Flycatchers are the smallestEmpidonaxflycatcher in the East. Like other flycatchers they tend to perch upright, but they appear a little more compact than most. The primary feathers on their wings are short, which makes their thin tail look longer.

Their head is grayish olive as well with a bold white eyering. They have a very faint yellow wash to the belly and 2 white wingbars.Least Flycatchers congregate in clusters in deciduous forests during the breeding season. They sing incessantly throughout the summer, tossing their head back with eachchebec. They tend to flit from perch to perch among dead branches in the middle to upper level of the forest canopy.Least Flycatchers breed in deciduous and mixed forests of all ages including second-growth and mature forests. These forests tend to have a few shrubs or small saplings in the understory and a well-developed canopy.",
